## Clonal hematopoiesis variant calling workflow

This repository contains most of the code used for the CH variant calling and analysis.

Since the data contains potentially sensitive personalized information, it is not made available here.
Additionally, not all the scripts are made available since they might contain internal patient IDs or similar.
